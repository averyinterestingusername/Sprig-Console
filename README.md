# Sprig-Console

Hello! Because I find the Sprig looks like a game controller, I wanted use it as one!

Disclaimer: Sadly, there is quite a lot of latency between pressing a key and it arriving at your PC. So although I really wanted to use it to play video games, it won't work for anything that requires precise timing. Or a mouse.

## Instructions

To make this work, you need to have a [Sprig](https://sprig.hackclub.com/) and a PC.
Alternatively, you can build your own Sprig from a Raspberry Pi Pico W and some buttons :)

### Setup

First, if you haven't already, you need to install Python and Thonny

Then, [install micropython on your Raspberry Pi Pico W](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico/3) (The board on the back of your Sprig): 

Manipulate my files:
- Download the files from this repsitory
- Fill out the credentials.py file
- Then, upload the files console_pico.py and credentials.py to your Pico
- Rename the console_pico.py file to main.py. This causes the program to run on your Pico as soon as it has power.

### Running the program

Before running the program, 
- Make sure your PC is connected to your network,
- And that the credentials.py file is identical on both devices.

Then:
- Run the console.py file
- Turn on your Sprig
- Wait for the little green LED on the back of your Sprig to turn on, indicating it has connected to your network

Voil√†! That should allow you to send keypresses over your WiFi network, and use your Sprig as a console/keyboard!

Disclaimer (again): Sadly, there is quite a lot of latency between pressing a key and it arriving at your PC. So although I really wanted to use it to play video games, it won't work for anything that requires precise timing. Or a mouse.
